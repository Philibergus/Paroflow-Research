# MCP Servers for Dental Practice Management

## Overview of Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic that standardizes how AI applications connect with external tools, data sources, and systems. For dental practice management, MCP provides a secure and compliant way to integrate AI assistants with practice systems.

## Key MCP Architecture Components

### Core Components
- **Hosts**: Applications the user interacts with (e.g., Claude Desktop, custom agents)
- **Clients**: Manage connections to specific MCP servers within host applications
- **Servers**: External programs exposing Tools, Resources, and Prompts via standard API

### Capabilities
- **Tools**: Functions that LLMs can call to perform actions (e.g., appointment scheduling)
- **Resources**: Data sources for LLMs to access (e.g., patient records, medical terminology)
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates for optimal tool/resource usage
