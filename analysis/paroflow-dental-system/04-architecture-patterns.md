# Architectural Patterns and Technologies for Paroflow

## HIPAA Compliance Architecture

### Core Security Patterns

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Identity Management**: Central user authentication and authorization
- **Permission Matrices**: Granular access control based on role and data sensitivity
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Users access only necessary data for their role
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all access attempts and data modifications

**Technical Implementation**:
```
User Roles:
├── Dentist (Full clinical access)
├── Hygienist (Limited clinical access)
├── Administrator (Administrative data only)
├── Receptionist (Scheduling and basic patient info)
└── External (API access for integrations)
```

#### 2. Encryption Architecture
**Multi-Layer Encryption Strategy**:
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for database storage
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Application-Level**: Field-level encryption for PHI
- **Device-Level**: Mobile device encryption requirements

**Key Management**:
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)**: For encryption key storage
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key lifecycle management
- **Escrow Procedures**: Secure key recovery processes

#### 3. Audit and Logging Infrastructure
**Comprehensive Audit Strategy**:
- **Access Logging**: Every data access attempt with user, time, and purpose
- **Modification Tracking**: Complete change history for all patient records
- **System Events**: Login attempts, failed authentications, system errors
- **Integration Logs**: All third-party system interactions

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Immutable Logs**: Write-only audit trail storage
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated HIPAA audit report generation
- **Long-term Retention**: 6+ year log retention as required by law
